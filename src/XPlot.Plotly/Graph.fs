In the future we could consider supporting relative commands, but we would have to decide on how to handle date and log axes. Note that even as is, Q and C Bezier paths that are smooth on linear axes may not be smooth on log, and vice versa. no chained "polybezier" commands - specify the segment type for each one. On category axes, values are numbers scaled to the serial numbers of categories because using the categories themselves there would be no way to describe fractional positions On data axes: because space and T are both normal components of path strings, we can't use either to separate date from time parts.
